# JS Quote Generator
Personal project meant to help me with JS DOM manipulation.

## Brief

This project started as a follow-along project. After completion, I decided to expand on it by turning it into a Dragonball Z theme.

Aside from the aesthetic changes, I added an image to the JS section which forced me to expand on my JS knowledge. Unlike the quote and the person's name, they both used the innerText property and a literal string, I had to use the innerHTML propery to make it work.
